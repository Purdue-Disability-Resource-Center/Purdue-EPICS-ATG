This document is intended to be a full manual, guide, and development record for the ATG Android application.
The ATG, as should be well known, stands for Automated Tour Guide, a device purposed to guide visually impaired 
students, faculty, parents, and other visitors around the campus without the use of an expensive mobility expert. \par
It has been long proposed that a phone app might be a suitable deployment of this technology, and now that it is coming to fruition
it is paramount that extremely good documentation be maintained along with it. It is fact that the DRC-ATG team's previous efforts have been
\emph{plagued}, not with bad programming, but lack of effective documentation. If we can successfully maintain and transfer
a knowledge base between teams, then this project may yet be completed.\par
With that in mind, this report shall not be static, but instead a living document. I shall write everything I know in it, but when 
later teams discover more, I expect them to integrate their knowledge with this report and add their own names to the title page.
Despite naysaying, I believe, with concerted effort, that this team truly can deliver a package of quality, usable software. Let us begin.
